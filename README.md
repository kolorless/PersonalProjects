# Ticket Finder

This project is a ticketing engine that takes input from the user and uses GoogleAPI, TicketMaster API, IpInfo API and various others to find the concert or game of your choice.

I have utilized a React frontend (using TypeScript) with a Django backend (using Python) to create this project. I have added a video for reference in the repository under the name <TicketFinder.mp4>

Hope you like what I've done!

P.S.

The Apikeys have been removed from this codebase for security purposes. Kindly add your own TicketMaster, IpInfo, and GoogleAPI keys to the code at the relevant places to be able to run the code
