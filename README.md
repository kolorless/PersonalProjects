# Ticket Finder

This project is a ticketing engine that takes input from the user and uses GoogleAPI, TicketMaster API, IpInfo API and various others to find the concert or game of your choice.

I have utilized a React frontend (using TypeScript) with a Django backend (using Python) to create this project. I have added a video for reference in the repository under the name <TicketFinder.mp4>

Hope you like what I've done!
