# PersonalProjects

I have done a few personal projects so far through my journey, this is one of them. I have only uploaded one based on how good the progress is since I do not want to upload a premature project

This project is a ticketing engine that takes input from the user and uses GoogleAPI, TicketMaster API, IpInfo API and various others to find the concert or game of your choice.

I have utilized a React frontend with a Django backend to create this project. I have added a video and zip file for reference in the repository.
